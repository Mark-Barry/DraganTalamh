# Getting Started Guide - Dragan Talamh

## Introduction
The project will primarily use **development** branch for all development efforts. The **master** branch will hold the most current version of the project which will be managed by the Code Owners [@fedpy](https://github.com/fedpy/) and [@Mark-Barry](https://github.com/Mark-Barry). Should there be a need to create a feature and/or functionality that is outside from the original project scope, a branch **features** will be used.

- **master** branch will contain the most current version of the application
- **development** branch is for all development efforts i.e. where work happens
- **features** branch is only for experimental features and/or functionalities
