## Git

The project will primarily use *development* branch for all development efforts.

The *master* branch will hold the most current version of the project which is going to be managed by the Code Owners (@fedpy and @Mark-Barry).

Should there be a need to develop a feature/functionality that is outside from the original project scope, a branch *features* will be used.

- *master* is the most current version of the application
- *development* branch is for all of the development efforts
- *features* is an experimental branch for features/functionalities from outside the original project scope
